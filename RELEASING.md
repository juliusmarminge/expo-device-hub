# Releasing

This monorepo publishes three public packages:

- **`expo-device-hub`** — the DevTools plugin.
- **`@expo/hub-client`** — the device-client hooks and the `DeviceScreen` component.
- **`@expo/serve-sim`** — the iOS simulator server in `packages/serve-sim/packages/serve-sim`.

Every other workspace package is marked `private` or listed in `.changeset/config.json` `ignore`,
and is skipped by the release tooling.

Releases are driven by [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets): the version
bump and changelog for each package are computed from the `.changeset/*.md` entries that have
accumulated since the last release. The **Release** GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is dispatched manually for real releases, runs automatically
as a canary release on every push to `main`, and publishes to npm using **OIDC Trusted
Publishing** (no long-lived `NPM_TOKEN`).

## Cutting a release

### 1. During development — add a changeset to your PR

Any change that should ship needs a changeset. From the repo root:

```sh
bun changeset
```

Select the package(s) you changed (`expo-device-hub`, `@expo/hub-client`, `@expo/serve-sim`), choose the
bump level (`patch` / `minor` / `major`), and write a summary. Changes to private workspace
packages that ship inside `expo-device-hub` belong in the `expo-device-hub` changeset. Commit
the generated `.changeset/*.md` file with your PR. Multiple PRs accumulate multiple changesets —
the release folds them together, and each package's final bump is the largest one requested
for it.

### 2. When ready to publish — run the workflow

Go to **Actions → Release → Run workflow**. The only input is **canary**:

- **off** (default) → real release. The workflow tests, builds, versions, publishes to npm,
  pushes the release commit and tags, and creates GitHub releases.
- **on** → canary release. The workflow tests, builds, and versions as usual, then rewrites each
  published package's version into a prerelease and publishes it under the **`canary`** npm
  dist-tag — without committing the version bump, pushing tags, or creating GitHub releases.
  Install it with `npm install expo-device-hub@canary`, and `latest` stays untouched.

Every push to `main` also runs the workflow as a canary release, so `@canary` always tracks the
latest commit on `main`.

Canary versions are `<release-version>-canary-<YYYYMMDD>-<short-sha>`. When a pending changeset
bumps a package, the canary uses that version directly (e.g. `0.3.0` with a minor changeset becomes
`0.4.0-canary-...`). Otherwise it uses the next minor version (e.g. `0.1.1` becomes
`0.2.0-canary-...`). The suffix contains the build date and released commit's short hash (e.g.
`expo-device-hub@0.2.0-canary-20260429-a5e59cf`). Unlike a real release, a canary does not require
a pending changeset, so you can publish one from any commit.

Real releases only version and publish the packages that have a changeset; the others stay put.
Canary releases assign every public package a canary version so they can also run without
pending changesets.

## One-time setup for a new public package

The workflow publishes with npm Trusted Publishing, so npm must know the package before its
first release. For every package that is not `private`:

1. Make sure the package exists on npm under the `@expo` scope (or is unscoped) and that the
   Expo org owns it.
2. On npmjs.com, open the package's **Settings → Trusted Publisher** and add a GitHub Actions
   publisher for the repository `expo/expo-device-hub`, the workflow file `release.yml`, and the
   environment `npm-publish`.
3. Keep `repository.url` in the package's `package.json` set to
   `https://github.com/expo/expo-device-hub.git`. npm rejects a provenance-signed publish when
   the URL does not match the repository that runs the workflow.
4. Add a changeset for the package so the next real release versions and publishes it.

`changeset publish` publishes every public package in the same run. If one of them fails to
publish, the workflow stops before it pushes tags or creates GitHub releases, even though the
version commit is already on `main`.
